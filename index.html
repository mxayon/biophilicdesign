          <h3>On Biophilic Environments.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The successful application of biophilic design fundamentally depends on adopting a new
            consciousness toward nature, recognizing how much our physical and mental wellbeing continues to rely on the quality of our connections to the world beyond ourselves of which we still remain a part.

          </h3>
          <p>
            We have programmed technology to adapt natures design, solving problems more than efficiently but impelementing conastant sustainable growth. Calm Computing, Persuasive Technology, Positive Computing are technobiophilic by-products,
            aside from
            physical adaptations but corresponding packaging of persuasive elements.

          <p>
            Biophilic design is the designing for people as a biological organism, respecting the mind-body systems as indicators of health and well-being in the context of what is locally appropriate and responsive.

          <h3>Biomimicry</h3>
          <p>
            Biomimicry is defined in the book as a "new science that studies nature's models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems". Benyus suggests
            looking to Nature as a "Model, Measure, and Mentor" and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry.

        <h3>LEAN & AGILE BIOPHILIC DESIGN STRATEGY</h3>
        <p>
          Aside from physiological features of nature that affect human biology through everyday visual interaction, identifying metaphoric similarities in structures can help keep engagement and culture elevated. Applying this to anything that
          evolves
          and takes on it's own lifecycle. Setting up environments to cultivate growth with an underlying cadence and heartbeat.

          Though physical biophilic workplace architecture may have a long build time and expensive to create, in essence of productivity, encapsulating main concpets in design through biomimicing is a combiniation of ideas intended to maintain
          constant
          growth.

        </h3>
        <p>
          The technology driving ecosystem is The Agile Release Train are the main elements released on the runway. The path can have multiple layers of ARTs if the surrounding organizations are well landscaped. In full coordination to each flag
          or
          segment in
          release path. The release path is
          measured, and the main metric's goal is for synchorizing all components.
        </p>
        <p>
          A well structured landscape allows complete access and transparency of available resources.
          <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/">ARTs</a> or Multiple ARTs in a value stream can be great for layered insights and multiple post processed assets in the asset bank.<br>

        <h3>Landscaping Value Stream Runways</h3>
        <p>
          The "mindfulness metronome " is the rythym the market and stakeholders provide. The business backbone for a sustainable runway. Able to pull from components, pre-tested before adding in a space provided in the value stream.

          It's a philosophy to synergize collaborative forces of the human component behind the ARTs. And an organic way of grouding the momentum on track with the rest of the system, via the synchrony belt on the value stream runway.
