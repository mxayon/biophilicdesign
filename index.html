        <h3>On Biophilic Environments.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The successful application of biophilic design fundamentally depends on adopting a new
          consciousness toward nature, recognizing how much our physical and mental wellbeing continues to rely on the quality of our connections to the world beyond ourselves of which we still remain a part.

        <h3>Biomimicry</h3>
        <p>
          Biomimicry is defined in the book as a "new science that studies nature's models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems". Benyus suggests
          looking to Nature as a "Model, Measure, and Mentor" and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry.

        <p>
          We have programmed technology to adapt natures design, solving problems more than efficiently but impelementing conastant sustainable growth. Calm Computing, Persuasive Technology, Positive Computing are technobiophilic by-products,
          aside from
          physical adaptations but corresponding packaging of persuasive elements.

        Much like how civilizations evolve around great bodies of water, sets and organizations should be landscaped around the ARTs and release runways, where all the bodies are involved with the cadence and measurement of its speed.

      <p> Each containerized stage is a lifecycle on it's own. With it's own momentum to measure and model & to strategically integrate with.

      <h3>LEAN & AGILE BIOPHILIC DESIGN STRATEGY</h3>
      <p>
        Aside from physiological features of nature that affect human biology through everyday visual interaction, identifying metaphoric similarities in structures can help keep engagement and culture elevated. Applying this to anything that
        evolves
        and takes on it's own lifecycle. Setting up environments to cultivate growth with an underlying cadence and heartbeat.
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Though physical biophilic workplace architecture may have a long build time and expensive to create, in essence of productivity, encapsulating main concpets in design through biomimicing is a combiniation of ideas intended to maintain
        constant
        growth.

      <h3> Biophilic Environments for ARTs and Runway Architechture
      </h3>
      <p>
        The technology driving ecosystem is The Agile Release Train are the main elements released on the runway. The path can have multiple layers of ARTs if the surrounding organizations are well landscaped. In full coordination to each flag
        or
        segment in
        release path. The release path is
        measured, and the main metric's goal is for synchorizing all components.
      </p>

        A well structured landscape allows complete access and transparency of available resources.

    <h3>Core Principles (© Scaled Agile, Inc.)
    </h3>
    <p class="principles">
      Take Economic View
      <br>
      Apply systems thinking
      <br>
      Assume variability; perserve options
      <br>
      Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
      <br>
      Base milestones on an objective evaluation of working systems
      <br>
      Visualize and limit WIP, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue length
      <br>
      Apply cadence; synchronize with cross-domain planning
      <br>
      Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers

      <h3>Landscaping Value Stream Runways</h3>
      <p>
        The "mindfulness metronome " is the rythym the market and stakeholders provide which branches down from marketing analysis and financial feasibility. The business backbone for a sustainable runway. Able to pull from components, pre-tested
        before adding in a space provided in the value stream.
        <br>
        It is a way to adopt the decentralized descion making process and develop with cadance. Both of which are essential in AGILE and LEAN methodologies
      </p>
      <p>
        This philosophy synergizes collaborative forces of the human component behind the ARTs. And an organic way of grouding the momentum on track with the rest of the system, via the synchrony belt on the value stream runway.

    <p>The Biophilic Design for Products is meant to be an idealistic product creation environment for cultivating collective development. It emphasizes that organizations within the whole product each need their own specialized environment,
      but

    <p>Merging two proven concpets with the observable patterns to engage everyone with design.
